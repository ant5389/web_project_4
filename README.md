**Intro**

This project is a web page for viewing photographs taken from around the United States along with their location names. It is intended for a specific person to create a profile with an avatar picture, their name, and a brief description of themselves or what they do. They can then add the photos they take and build up a collection for others to see. You can even mark which pictures you like the most.

**Techniques**

The techniques used to create this page include a customizable profile name, description, and avatar image created through javascript by opening up a popup window. The popup window appears with a tinted overlay to focus attention and make each window easier to read. You can submit a custom input to edit the corresponding fields on the profile page. Each photograph is laid out in a structured grid with each location having its own card. Each card has a location name with a functional like button and a total like count. If the location name is too long for the card, ellipses are created to keep a clean overall look. Users have the ability to add their own custom photos onto the existing photo grid by inputting a link. You can also remove photos and like your favorite ones. All overlays appear in a smooth fade transition. All cards are pulled from a main server so added cards will remain and show for all users. A user can only delete a card that they have added themselves to protect the integrity of the page. Each image on the card can be clicked for a more complete view of the picture.

**Future Improvements**

Future improvements include making the site more responsive and react quicker in pulling from the server.
